# GPI_Dashboard
Presented Global Peace Index Rankings in a medium that would be presentable to potential stakeholders.
Dashboard results showed as screenshots instead of deployed on shinyapp, due to limited deployments allowed to free users.

Data Sourced from Wikipedia while browsing for interesting data to grab.
Found it pretty neat how there was a subjective scoring for national peace. Canada is pretty steady at Rank 6.
